<p>

  In the early Meiji era, after participating in the Bakumatsu war as the assassin "Hitokiri Battosai",
  Himura Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement
  for the murders he once committed. When arriving in Tokyo in the 11th year of Meiji (1878), he meets a
  young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who is in the middle of a fight with a murderer
  - who claims to be the Hitokiri Battosai - tarnishing the name of the swordsmanship school that she teaches.
  Kenshin decides to help her and defeats the fake Battosai. After discovering that Kenshin is the real infamous
  assassin, Kaoru offers him a place to stay at her dojo noting that he is peace-loving and not cold-hearted,
   as his reputation implies. Kenshin accepts and begins to establish lifelong relationships with many people such as Sagara Sanosuke,
   a former Sekiho Army member; Myojin Yahiko, an orphan from a samurai family who is also living with Kaoru as her student;
   and a doctor named Takani Megumi, caught in the opium trade. However, he also deals with his fair share of enemies, new and old,
   including the former leader of the Oniwabanshu, Shinomori Aoshi and a rival from the Bakumatsu turned police officer,
   Saito Hajime.

   <p>

  After several months of living in the dojo, Kenshin discovers that his successor as assassin of the shadows,
  Shishio Makoto, plans to conquer Japan by destroying the Meiji Government, starting with Kyoto.
  Feeling that his friends may be attacked by Shishio's faction, Kenshin goes to meet Shishio alone in order to defeat him.
  However, many of his friends decide to help him in his fight. After his first meeting with him,
  Kenshin realizes he needs to get stronger to defeat Shishio without becoming the cold assassin
  he was in the past and returns to the man who taught him kenjutsu, Hiko Seijuro, in order to learn the school's final technique.
  He finally accepts his friends' help and defeats Shishio in a close fight; Shishio dies being engulfed
  in flames due to the rise in his body temperature caused by his severe burns.

<h2 id="news">OVA: Reflection</h2>

<img src="http://www.new-anime.com/images/rurouni-kenshin-reflection_3.jpg" alt="ova1" width="50%" align="right">


<p>

The OVA starts out as a montage of singular events surrounding the life of Kenshin Himura,
told from the point of view of Kaoru Kamiya. Then the remainder of it involves Kenshin, who
becomes tortured anew by the guilt of leading a happy life after such a destructive past.
He makes the decision to wander again, and Kaoru strongly supports him, promising to welcome
him home with a smile and their child. For fifteen years, he wanders, returning every once in a while.

<p>
However, this leads his son, Kenji Himura to hold resentment towards Kenshin for leaving them.
Now in his adolescence, he leaves for Kyoto hoping to learn Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryu from Seijuro Hiko,
hoping to be as strong as his father, and create his own legend. Soon however, Yahiko Myojin tracks
him down at the request of Kaoru. He wears the mark of evil on his back, too. Yahiko duels him to
show him the delusions of achieving his father's greatness. Yahiko admits that he is a genius and
has natural talent as a swordsman. However, he knew that neither passion, discipline, nor skill
would make Kenji superior to his father. So, in a one final strike, Yahiko lets Kenji experience
the full brunt of Kenshin's Sakabatou; allowing Kenji to experience the strength of his father's
philosophy firsthand. Falling to his knee, Yahiko presented Kenji with the Sakabat≈ç as a late
genpuku gift, hoping that now he'd realize that Kenshin's strength lay not in his ability to kill,
but in his appreciation of life, his devotion and self-sacrifice to those in need.

<p>

Meanwhile, Kenshin eventually becomes ravaged by an unknown disease that is much like leprosy.
Kenshin then leaves to go assist in the First Sino-Japanese War (primarily over control of Korea) as he
had promised the Meiji Government, not fighting and killing, but instead helping people.
After the war's end, Sanosuke discovers a very ill Kenshin sometime after he had fallen overboard on a ship.
Sanosuke arranges Kenshin's return to Tokyo by boat. Upon arriving, a bed-ridden Kaoru,
almost on instinct, gets up to walk outside the dojo on the cherry blossom path, seeing
her husband struggling with each step to meet her.
The two finally meet, and Kenshin collapses into her arms as he clutches her to him.
Kenshin tells Kaoru that he returned for her, and Kaoru quietly greets him with his old name, Shinta,
for he had asked it before he left the last time. Soon, they end up beneath a cherry blossom tree,
where Kaoru tells him that they will invite everyone for a cherry blossom viewing, and continue to
gather in the years to come. With the silence growing stronger, Kaoru realizes that Kenshin has died
quietly in her arms. Upon brushing his hair off his left cheek, Kaoru notices Kenshin's scar has faded away,
signifying that his journey of atonement is finally over. In the final scene before the credits,
she holds his head in her arms and weeps.
After the credits finish rolling, there is a scene which shows Kenshin and Kaoru's son, Kenji,
walking with a young girl, Chizuru, beneath the cherry blossoms, saying that they will live happily together.

<p>

While a raid of bandits slay a group of travelers, a young boy named Shinta is saved from death by a passing swordsman.
The swordsman, known as Hiko Seijuro, is a master of the Hiten Mitsurugi, the strongest of all sword forms.
Hiko takes Shinta as an apprentice and renames him "Kenshin", a name which he felt was more appropriate for a swordsman.
After years of training, Kenshin leaves his master, convinced that the only way to uphold the Hiten Mitsurugi's
pledge to help the weak and innocent is to join the revolution poised to upend the Tokugawa shogunate.
He joins the Choshu clan and soon works for their leader, Katsura Kogoro, as an assassin. Kenshin soon becomes a hardened killer,
feared far and wide as the Hitokiri Battosai. During a successful assassination, he kills a bodyguard named
Kiyosato Akira. The encounter with Kiyosato leaves Kenshin with the first half of his cross-shaped scar.
After killing a skilled assassin, Kenshin meets a woman named Yukishiro Tomoe, unaware of the fact that she is
the fiancee of Kiyosato. Kenshin takes her to the inn where he and the men of the Choshu clan are residing.
Katsura suspects a spy among the Choshu after Kenshin informs him of the assassin he killed.
After the Ikedaya affair, Katsura arranges for Kenshin and Tomoe to hide in the village of Otsu as husband and wife,
so the two would not be suspected. After a few months, Tomoe's brother Enishi comes to visit and secretly
reveals to his sister that the shogunate agents assigned to track down and kill Kenshin are close by, and that
her revenge will be complete. Tomoe sends Enishi off, feeling ill at ease. It is here that Tomoe realizes
that she has fallen in love with Kenshin. Kenshin, too, is in love with Tomoe. The next morning, Tomoe leaves
the house and tries to deceive the shogunate men into giving up their pursuit of Kenshin and unsuccessfully
attempts to kill their leader.

<p>

After Tomoe's disappearance, Kenshin is visited by a comrade who tells him that the spy was
Tomoe and that she is meeting at that moment with her co-conspirators. He also reveals to Kenshin that she
is the fiancee of Kiyosato, the man he killed. Kenshin, however, is unaware that it is this man who is the real spy.
While heading to Tomoe's location, a heavily-shocked Kenshin faces and kills three of the four shogunate agents
but becomes badly injured due to his traumatized state. While Kenshin is fighting with the last agent (a fist fighter),
Tomoe steps in between the two to protect Kenshin from the killing punch. This allows Kenshin to kill the agent but,
in doing so, unintentionally impales Tomoe also. Before her death, she gives him the second part of his cross-shaped
wound.

 <p>

Kenshin, blaming himself for Tomoe's death, swears to fight to bring about the age desired by Katsura,
but after that to continue fighting to protect the innocent without killing again.
Katsura informs Kenshin that he had a new assassin kill the real spy.
As the Tokugawa shogunate is nearing its end, Kenshin has his first encounter with the Shinsengumi
captains Okita Soji and his future rival, Saito Hajime. It is then revealed that once the Bakumatsu
revolution had ended, the Hitokiri Batt≈çsai had disappeared without a trace. Then Kenshin returns to the graves
of the women he buried when he was a child and places Tomoe's scarf on them.
Sometime afterwards, Hiko Seijuro returned to the site and notices the scarf, realizing Kenshin had
returned and he had barely missed his former student.
